### Here, I provide examples for both Harmony and Seurat integration, briefly discussing the functionality of both approaches.

#Seurat integration: 
ifnb <- IntegrateLayers(object = ifnb, method = CCAIntegration, orig.reduction = "pca", new.reduction = "integrated.cca",
    verbose = FALSE)

# re-join layers after integration
ifnb[["RNA"]] <- JoinLayers(ifnb[["RNA"]])

ifnb <- FindNeighbors(ifnb, reduction = "integrated.cca", dims = 1:30)
ifnb <- FindClusters(ifnb, resolution = 1)
