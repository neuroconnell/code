# R and Python code for analysis of scRNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing data
A library of R and Python code, leveraging modern single-cell analyses methods to predict gene expression and chromatin accessibility of sorted serotonergic neurons. Repositories include example applications of native Seurat and Signac tools, alternative and advanced analysis pipelines for modeling/DEG, and machine learning methods for feature extraction. I also compare Bayesian vs Frequentist approaches for DEG prediction.

R Repositories:
  1. General Seurat analysis pipeline
  2. General Signac analysis pipeline
  3. NEBULA (Negative binomial modeling) for DEG prediction (frequentist)
  4. BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data) for DEG prediction
  5. ParetoTI (Task inference for identifying archetypal gene expression programs)

Python Repository:

  1. scANVI for latent space feature extraction
